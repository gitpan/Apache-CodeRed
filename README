Apache/CodeRed version 1.06
===========================

This module detects attacks from the CodeRed (and CodeRed II) worm.
When such an attack occurs, it (a) sends e-mail to an address
specified by SecurityFocus, and (b) attempts to send e-mail to
administrative addresses at the attacking domain.  By sending
automatic messages to the system administrators, we hope that an
increasing number of computers will be patched, saving the Internet
from eventual decline into oblivion.
