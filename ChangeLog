	* CodeRed.pm (handler): Got DNS lookups working once again.
	Upped the version to 1.07.

	* CodeRed.pm (handler): Changed from $r->log_error to $r->warn,
	which allows administrators to filter messages out of the error
	log more easily.

	* README: Put some information in the README.

	* CodeRed.pm: Checked everything into CVS.

	* Makefile.PL: Added prerequisites, so that CPAN.pm and other
	installation tools will let you know if you need the latest
	versions of various modules.  Truth be told, I'm not sure what the
	minimum versions are for the required modules, so I just set them
	to the current values and will hope for the best.

	* CodeRed.pm: What didn't I do?  I wrote some POD, gave the module
	a new name (Apache::CodeRed, rather than plain ol' CodeRed),
	retooled a few basic things, removed some bugs.
